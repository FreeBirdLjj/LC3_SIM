    <string name = "InfoHead">Have you read <i>Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits &amp; Gates to C &amp; Beyond</i> written by Yale N. Patt &amp; Sanjay J. Patel? This app is the simulation of the LC-3 computer. This app uses imagebuttons, and the legends are as follow:</string>
    <string name = "HelpTitle">Help</string>

    <string name = "Open">it is used to OPEN and load LC-3 program (in .obj format), and cannot be used while the simulator is RUNNING.</string>
    <string name = "Jump">The memdump can only continuously display 0x40 Memory Unit in total, so you need this button to JUMP TO where you want.</string>
    <string name = "Input">There is a input buffer in the simulator, and you can input in it. You can only input while the input buffer is empty. (The upper state means the input buffer is empty and you can input, the lowwer means opposite)</string>
    <string name = "Thanks">Thanks for using this app. You support me by using my app(s), and your support is my impetus.</string>
