# SDK vs NDK

I want the simulator can run on all the android devices, including x86-based and MIPS-based devices. So I only use SDK which means I only write Java codes.

# I18N & L10N

Just as any other android project, add a folder named `values-LANG` with strings.xml inside in `res/` and then send PR to me. res/values-zh is an example.
